# Topic: Examining the influence of El-Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on tropical storm intensity in the western North Pacific Basin

## Summary
For my final project, I will be investigating how changes in ENSO over time influences tropical storm intensity by using accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) as a measure of storm strength. I will be analyzing the data used by [Camargo and Sobel 2004](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI3457.1) from 1950-2002 in an attempt to replicate their figures to determine if I can produce results consistent to their findings, and I will additionally, be analyzing data that was not available to them at the time (2003-2018) to determine whether or not their conclusions have persisted over time. From the paper, I will be trying to replicate and modify Figures 1, 2, 4, and 7 to ensure that I am able to consistently produce their results and include new data to see if they follow the previously observed pattern.

## Datasets:
- [Best Track data from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center](http://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html?western-pacific)
- [Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) Data from the Climate Prediction Center](http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/data/indices/)
